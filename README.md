# 📘 QuickTools – Quick Notes Module

> A lightweight, browser-based note-taking tool built with vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and localStorage. Part of the larger *QuickTools* vision, this standalone **Notes** module lets you create, manage, and export notes easily — no account or server required.

---

### 🚀 Features

* 🗂 **Folder-Based Note Management**
  Create, organize, and group notes inside collapsible folders.

* 📝 **Rich Editing Interface**
  Edit titles and content in a simple, distraction-free layout.

* 💾 **Persistent Storage (localStorage)**
  Your notes are saved directly to the browser — nothing is uploaded to a server.

* 📤 **Export as PDF**
  Generate a styled, printable PDF of your notes using [pdfMake](https://pdfmake.github.io/docs/).

* 🎯 **Keyboard Shortcuts**

  * `Ctrl + N`: New note
  * `Ctrl + F`: Add folder
  * `Ctrl + D`: Delete selected note

* 🧩 **Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS**
  This is the first project using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), resulting in a modern, responsive, utility-first UI.

* 📬 **Contact The Developer**
  You can send feedback directly through the in-app contact form.
However, to avoid confusion (like encountering vague errors such as “error code 42”) and to get a quicker, more personalized response, I **recommend reaching out via social media**:

### 📁 Project Structure

📌 Subject to Change
> This is an early-phase implementation of the Notes module. As QuickTools evolves into a multi-module productivity suite, the file structure may change to support modular scalability and maintainability.

```
quicktools/
├── index.html
├── js/
│   ├── constant.js
│   ├── notes.js
│   └── main.js
├── css/
│   └── tailwind.css (via CDN)
└── assets/
```

### 📌 Current Status

* ✅ Notes module is fully functional.
* ✅ Local storage works across sessions.
* ✅ PDF export added — major feature for sharing.
* ✅ Contact option added, with social links provided.
* ⏳ Other modules (Checklists, Links, Images) are **planned**, but **not yet implemented**.

### 🌱 Project Vision

> QuickTools is intended as a modular productivity app. While only the Notes module is currently complete, the end goal is to support Checklists, Image collections, and Link bookmarks — all unified under a clean, keyboard-friendly interface, powered entirely on the browser.
